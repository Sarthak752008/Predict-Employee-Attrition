Predict Employee Attrition
This project aims to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using a machine learning classification model. The prediction is based on various features, such as job satisfaction, salary, work environment, and years of experience.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "6. Predict Employee Attrition.csv", containing information about employees and a target column Attrition (Yes/No), which indicates whether the employee left the company or not.

💡 Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping irrelevant columns.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The performance is visualized using a confusion matrix heatmap.

🧰 Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

seaborn: For data visualization.

matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and utilities, including model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter-compatible environment.

Upload the dataset file when prompted:

6. Predict Employee Attrition.csv

Run the steps in the notebook sequentially:

Import libraries

Upload and load the dataset

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, drop irrelevant columns)

Train the model

Make predictions

Evaluate performance

📊 Model Evaluation
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances among all the instances.

Precision: The proportion of positive class predictions that are actually correct.

Recall: The proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified by the model.

The model performance is visualized with a confusion matrix heatmap, which shows how well the model predicted the attrition (whether an employee stayed or left).

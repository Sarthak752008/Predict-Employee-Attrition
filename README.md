Predict Employee Attrition
This project predicts employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using a machine learning model. The prediction is based on factors like job satisfaction, salary, work environment, and experience.

📁 Dataset
Dataset: "6. Predict Employee Attrition.csv"

Target: Attrition (Yes/No)

💡 Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset (missing values, encoding, irrelevant columns).

Model: Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Visualized with a confusion matrix.

🧰 Libraries Used
pandas: Data manipulation

seaborn & matplotlib: Data visualization

scikit-learn: Model training & evaluation

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download this repo.

Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload "6. Predict Employee Attrition.csv".

Run the notebook.

📊 Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.

Precision: Correct positive predictions.

Recall: True positives identified.

The model’s performance is visualized with a confusion matrix heatmap.
